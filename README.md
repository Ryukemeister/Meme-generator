# Make memes, not war.

My first ever project where I've utilized useState and useEffect hooks in React and build controlled components so that I can fetch a random meme image after every click of the 'Get a new meme image' button. It's not a lot but it's good enough to get started. I got introduced to a lot of concepts and techniques, how to map data and create components from it, how to manage the state of a component, how to make api calls in React and also to control side effects in React.
