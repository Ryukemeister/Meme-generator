# Make memes, not war.

![Meme generator image](public/Meme%20generator.jpg)

My first ever project where I'm utilizing useState and useEffect hooks in React and building controlled components so that I can fetch a random meme image after every click of the 'Get a new meme image' button. It's not a lot but it's good enough to get started. I got introduced to a lot of concepts and techniques, how to map data and create components from it, manage the state of the component and how to control side effects in React.
